# Class-of-Algorithms
The program contains classes and functions of algorithm made of matrix multiplications, checking the number of binary representation in n's binary form, etc.
The Gaussian Elimination included in the code runs into an finite loop. It was added for refrencing on sequential algorithm and it's time complexity.
